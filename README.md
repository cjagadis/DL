Experiments with Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks using VsCode

Titanic folder ML example is based on the [Tutorial on VsCode for ML](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial).
For anybody who does a lot of ML work, VsCode is ideal. Please check it out. I have worked on their Tutorial line-by-line and
was extremely useful.


Rest of the folder may or may not have anything to do with VsCode. That said, I will use VsCode for all future ML work.
