## Folder Titanic - Tutorial on Using Vscode for ML/Data Science
Titanic folder ML example is based on the [Tutorial on VsCode for ML](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial).
For anybody who does a lot of ML work, VsCode is ideal. Please check it out. I have worked on their Tutorial line-by-line and
was extremely useful.
